                <p><strong>&#8203;Opening Spring 2017</strong><br><br>We’re excited to introduce our new attraction Lotherton Wildlife World, which will see our current Bird Garden go through a series of significant developments. <br>&nbsp;<br>In spring 2017 we’ll be opening a new visitor centre and adding to our animal collection with the introduction of penguins, flamingos and forest mammals. Lotherton Wildlife World will tell the story of our natural heritage, while drawing on the travels of previous owners of the estate, the Gascoignes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>What's it all about?</strong><br>Come and get to know our animals, how they live and what we can do to protect their future. Our new Wildlife World will contribute to conservation initiatives and aim to raise awareness of endangered animals and plant species through an exciting learning and events programme.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Follow our progress:</strong><br>We’ll be keeping you informed of updates through social media.

                <p>Lotherton Hall has evolved over the last few centuries. There is evidence that there was a Georgian house on the site and the earliest parts&nbsp;are believed to be Regency. </p>
<p>The Chapel dates from the 12th century and once part of the medieval village of Luttrington and is dedicated to St James. <br><br>The house was extended in late Victorian and in Edwardian times by Colonel Gascoigne to create a country home for his family. Sir Alvary and Lady Gascoigne gave the house and estate&nbsp;to the city of Leeds in 1968.<br></p>
<p><strong>Collection and exhibitions</strong><br>The house contains a fabulous decorative art collection,&nbsp;the Fashion Galleries, and&nbsp;you can get&nbsp;a glimpse of where the house staff once worked in the restored Servants’ Rooms.<br><br>Lotherton Hall&nbsp;hosts a regular exhibition programme in the Fashion Galleries and changing displays in the Servants’ Hall. </p>

<p><strong>Edwardian Gardens<br><br></strong><span class="limitedrte-Style-Normal">The gardens cover 8 acres and were designed mainly by Gwendolyn Gascoigne between 1903-49, as</span><span class="limitedrte-Style-Normal"> a</span> series of enclosed gardens. </p>
<p>The old Walled Garden was transformed into an "old-fashioned" garden filled with rose beds and herbaceous borders with scented flowers, tender creepers and perennials. The William and Mary Garden was built with a sunken pond and plant walls. Part of the Victorian shrubbery was made into a rock garden,&nbsp;with winding sunken paths and a hard tennis court was laid out overlooking the pasture.</p>
<p>Today, the gardens are being slowly restored to their former state. <br><br><strong><br>Bird Garden&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong></strong>With over 480 individual birds, from more than 130 different species, the Bird Garden has developed into one of the UK's premier collections of rare and endangered birdlife. <br><br><a href="/museumsandgalleries/Pages/lothertonhall/Bird-Garden.aspx">Explore the Bird Garden</a><br><br><strong><br>The Estate</strong><br><br>Beyond the formal gardens,&nbsp;walk along the fence of the Deer Park and watch the herd of red deer grazing. Saunter off the beaten track onto Ranger's Walk; or continue beyond the Bird Garden entrance, and the countryside is only footsteps away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li><strong>Orchard: </strong>Planted in 2005, in partnership with the Northern Fruit Group,&nbsp;the Orchard contains 109 varieties of trees, including many from the Yorkshire region.</li></ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul><li><strong>Deer Park: </strong>Lotherton has its own herd of red deer. Visit the new Deer Hide and see how many you can count! </li></ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul><li><strong>Free-Play Areas: </strong>Lotherton is a great place to let off steam. Everyone can make use of our free-play fields. Feel free to bring your own games, fly a kite or have a kick about with all your friends and family. <br></li></ul>
